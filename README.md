# Reddit Clone with NextJS and Supabase

## Description 
A Reddit clone build in NextJS with database at Supabase. The app is styled with TailwindCSS - I can safely say it is my new fave. This was my first time using [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app) hooks and I was amazed how it works! 

The app is deployed at: [redditclone-mkchahal.vercel.app](https://redditclone-mkchahal.vercel.app). Google login will be required to access the homepage.

## Getting Started

The app could be started by running `yarn dev`. All the pages could be accessed under **pages** folder and the backend apis in **pages > api** folder.
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on say `/api/get-comments`. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/get-comments.js`.
